    <h1>Image Formats</h1>
    <p>
      There’s four main image formats in use on the web, and they were all designed to do different things. Understanding their intended purpose goes
      a long way towards improving the quality of your web pages.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>JPG</li>
      <li>GIF</li>
      <li>PNG</li>
      <li>SVG</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The next few sections will walk through ideal use cases for each of these image formats.</p>

    <h2>JPG</h2>
    <p>
      PG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes them great for photos and images
      with lots of gradients in them. On the other hand, JPGs don’t allow for transparent pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the image
      below if you look real close:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="Mochi jpg" />
    <h2>GIF</h2>
    <p>
      GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette—never use them for
      photos. Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels. This can make it difficult to get high
      levels of detail on a transparent background. For this reason, it’s usually better to use PNG images if you don’t need animation.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt="Mochi gif" />
    <h2>PNG</h2>
    <p>
      PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated. For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would
      generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don’t have color palette limitations.
      This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt="Mochi png" />
    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss
      of quality. This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. They’re good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs,
      and you should use them whenever you can.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.svg" alt="Mochi svg" width="100" height="100" />
    <img src="../images/mochi.svg" alt="Mochi svg" width="300" height="300" />
    <br />
    <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt="Mochi png" width="100" height="100" />
    <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt="Mochi png" width="300" height="300" />
    <p>
      These 300×300 pixel images were originally 100×100 pixels, but scaling them up clearly shows the difference between them. Notice the crisp,
      clean lines on the top SVG image, while the PNG image on the bottom is now very pixelated.
