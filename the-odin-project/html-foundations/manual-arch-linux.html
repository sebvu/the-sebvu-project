    <p>So you're interesting in installing <em>Arch Linux</em>?</p>
    <p>And you want to <em>manually</em> install it?</p>
    <p>
      Then you've come to the right place! Screw install scripts. We're doing it
      manual labor
    </p>

    <h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>
    <p>
      We will be <em>dual booting</em> on our system, so here are the
      pre-requisites.
    </p>
    <p>This blog post is <em>assumimg</em> you are operating on Windows 11.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>x86_64 (i.e. 64 bit) compatible machine</li>
      <li>Recommended 2 GB RAM, minimum of 512 GB</li>
      <li>Recommended 20 GB disk space, minimum 800 MB</li>
      <li>8GB+ Pendrive <strong>(EVERYTHING WILL BE WIPED)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have all of these, lets get started!</p>

    <h2>Installing Arch Linux</h2>
    <h3>Creating Partitions</h3>
    <p>
      Open windows search bar, and type <strong>diskmgmt</strong> to access disk
      manager where you can view all connected drives and their respective
      partitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here, you want to look for your drive of choice (typically (C: D: E:,
      or maybe under another alias) and
      <strong>shrink a minimum of 20GB</strong> of space for Arch Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will create an unallocated free space. Now we have free space for
      installing Arch Linux!
    </p>

    <h3>Downloading ISO</h3>
    <p>
      Choose the closes mirror to your location, then download the Arch ISO
      here.<a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Connect your USB stick to your computer. We will be burning our ISO into
      our USB using <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">rufus</a> and creating a
      <strong>bootable USB drive</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>WARNING: THIS WILL WIPE ANY CONTENTS IN YOUR USB STICK</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Open rufus, and <em>select boot selection</em> and look for your
      downloaded archlinux ISO.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it is selected, click start, agree to all of the options, and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have created your bootable USB, it is time to create a restore
      point.
    </p>

    <h3>Windows Restore Point</h3>
    <p>
      We are going to taking a <em>snapshot</em>of the current state of windows
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In windows search bar, search up <strong>Create a restore point</strong>,
      click on your current drive, click on 'create a restore point' and click
      okay.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything goes wrong with the arch installation, you can reboot to that
      saved window state.
    </p>
    <p>Once that is done, we will now be going to our UEFI settings.</p>

    <h3>UEFI Settings</h3>
    <p>
      Search up in your windows search bar <strong>UEFI settings</strong> and
      choose to reeboot to UEFI settings. You can also restart you system and
      spam <em>F12 + F2 (may vary with different computers)</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Navigate to your UEFI settings, <strong>enable</strong> USB boot, and
      <strong>set boot priorty></strong> for <strong>USB drive.</strong> You
      will also have to <strong>disable</strong> secure boot option.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now restart your system. You will see a few bootable options,
      <strong>choose Arch Linux</strong>
    </p>
    <p>You are now in arch linux!</p>

    <h3>Booted up Arch Linux!</h3>
