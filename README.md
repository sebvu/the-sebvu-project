# The Sebvu Project

My collection of leetcode studies and odin project studies. This is an accountability repository, meaning that I am holding myself at gunpoint to do this.

The goal of **The Sebvu Project** is to give myself a solid base preperation for a fullstack software development career in the long term. This will serve as a accountability portfolio for myself in the goal of being consistent and in preperation for a potential software development internship/Google STEP internship.

- Leetcode commits will be formatted in a way of an answer submission to a leetcode problem, followed by an explanation of the solution. All questions will be done in python.
